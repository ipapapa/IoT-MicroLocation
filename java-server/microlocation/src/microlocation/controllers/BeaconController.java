               throws ServletException,
                      IOException
Called by the server (via the service method) to allow a servlet to handle a POST request.
 The HTTP POST method allows the client to send data of unlimited length to the Web server
  a single time and is useful when posting information such as credit card numbers.
When overriding this method, read the request data, write the response headers, get 
the response's writer or output stream object, and finally, write the response data. 
It's best to include content type and encoding. When using a PrintWriter object to 
return the response, set the content type before accessing the PrintWriter object.

The servlet container must write the headers before committing the response, because 
in HTTP the headers must be sent before the response body.
Where possible, set the Content-Length header 
(with the ServletResponse.setContentLength(int) method), to allow the servlet container
 to use a persistent connection to return its response to the client, improving performance. The content length is automatically set if the entire response fits inside the response buffer.

When using HTTP 1.1 chunked encoding (which means that the response has a Transfer-Encoding
 header), do not set the Content-Length header.

This method does not need to be either safe or idempotent. Operations requested through 
POST can have side effects for which the user can be held accountable, for example, 
updating stored data or buying items online.

If the HTTP POST request is incorrectly formatted, doPost returns an HTTP "Bad Request" 
message.

Parameters:
req - an HttpServletRequest object that contains the request the client has made of the 
servlet (the client has asked for beacon service information in our case)
resp - an HttpServletResponse object that contains the response the servlet sends to the
 client  (the response from database )
Throws:
IOException - if an input or output error is detected when the servlet handles the request
ServletException - if the request for the POST could not be handled

ServletOutputStream, ServletResponse.setContentType(java.lang.String)
